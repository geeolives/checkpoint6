SASS - I tried implementing variables for Sass but it did not work.

SVGS - I made my social media icons into SVGs. 

Flexbox - I used a Navigation flexbox but it also did not work. But it is responsive.

Web Animations - Included a web animation on the donation box on the contact page just to fulfill the requirement.

Responsiveness - Did not have time to make the site fully responsive. Only the navigation. 

I designed the website as closely as possible to what I created in Photoshop.
